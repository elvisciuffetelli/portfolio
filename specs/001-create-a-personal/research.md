# Phase 0: Research & Technology Decisions

## Next.js 15 with App Router

**Decision**: Use Next.js 15+ with App Router for the portfolio website  
**Rationale**: 
- App Router is the current recommended approach for new Next.js projects
- Provides better performance with server components and streaming
- Built-in support for layouts, loading states, and error handling
- Excellent TypeScript integration
- Static site generation capabilities for portfolio use case

**Alternatives considered**:
- Next.js Pages Router: Older pattern, less performant
- Vite + React: More configuration needed, no built-in SSG
- Gatsby: Overkill for simple portfolio, more complex setup

## TailwindCSS for Styling

**Decision**: Use TailwindCSS for styling with shadcn/ui components  
**Rationale**:
- Utility-first approach enables rapid UI development
- Excellent responsive design utilities
- Tree-shaking removes unused CSS automatically
- shadcn/ui provides pre-built, accessible components
- Consistent design system approach

**Alternatives considered**:
- CSS Modules: More verbose, less design system oriented
- Styled Components: Runtime overhead, less performant
- Plain CSS: Harder to maintain, no utility classes

## shadcn/ui Component Library

**Decision**: Use shadcn/ui for UI components  
**Rationale**:
- Copy-paste components (no runtime dependency)
- Built on Radix UI primitives for accessibility
- Customizable with CSS variables
- TypeScript support out of the box
- Good integration with TailwindCSS

**Alternatives considered**:
- Mantine: Runtime dependency, more opinionated
- Chakra UI: Different design philosophy
- Building from scratch: Time-consuming, accessibility challenges

## Data Management Strategy

**Decision**: Use static JSON file with TypeScript interfaces  
**Rationale**:
- Simple portfolio content doesn't require database
- Easy to update and maintain
- Type safety with TypeScript interfaces
- No server-side complexity needed
- Perfect for static site generation

**Alternatives considered**:
- Headless CMS: Overkill for personal portfolio
- Database: Unnecessary complexity for static content
- Markdown files: JSON provides better structure for this use case

## Component Architecture

**Decision**: Modular, reusable components with clear separation of concerns  
**Rationale**:
- ExperienceCard, ProjectCard, SkillBadge components for reusability
- Section-based layout components (HeroSection, AboutSection, etc.)
- Custom hooks for data management and responsive behavior
- Clear prop interfaces for type safety

**Alternatives considered**:
- Single large component: Hard to maintain and test
- Page-based components only: Less reusable
- Over-abstracted components: Unnecessary complexity for portfolio

## Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Jest with React Testing Library for component testing  
**Rationale**:
- Industry standard for React testing
- Focuses on user behavior rather than implementation
- Good TypeScript support
- Accessibility testing utilities
- Integration with Next.js testing setup

**Alternatives considered**:
- Cypress: Overkill for simple portfolio site
- Vitest: Newer but Jest more established for React
- No testing: Poor practice for maintainable code

## Responsive Design Approach

**Decision**: Mobile-first responsive design with TailwindCSS breakpoints  
**Rationale**:
- Mobile usage dominates web traffic
- TailwindCSS provides excellent responsive utilities
- Portfolio needs to work perfectly on all devices
- Progressive enhancement from mobile base

**Alternatives considered**:
- Desktop-first: Less optimal for mobile experience
- Separate mobile site: Unnecessary complexity
- Non-responsive: Unacceptable in modern web development

## Performance Optimization

**Decision**: Static Site Generation (SSG) with image optimization  
**Rationale**:
- Portfolio content is static, perfect for SSG
- Fastest possible loading times
- Next.js Image component for optimized images
- Automatic code splitting and bundling
- Perfect Lighthouse scores achievable

**Alternatives considered**:
- Server-Side Rendering: Unnecessary for static content
- Client-Side Rendering: Slower initial load
- No optimization: Poor user experience

## Accessibility Standards

**Decision**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with semantic HTML  
**Rationale**:
- Professional portfolio should be accessible to all users
- shadcn/ui components include accessibility features
- Semantic HTML structure for screen readers
- Proper color contrast and keyboard navigation

**Alternatives considered**:
- Basic accessibility: Insufficient for professional presence
- WCAG AAA: Potentially overkill for portfolio site
- No accessibility considerations: Unacceptable practice

## Deployment Strategy

**Decision**: Static site deployment (Vercel/Netlify) with automatic builds  
**Rationale**:
- Next.js works excellently with Vercel (same company)
- Automatic deployments from Git
- CDN distribution for global performance
- Zero server maintenance required

**Alternatives considered**:
- Traditional hosting: More complex, less performant
- Docker containers: Unnecessary for static site
- Self-hosting: More maintenance overhead
