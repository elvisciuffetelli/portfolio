# Implementation Plan: Personal Developer Portfolio Page

**Branch**: `001-create-a-personal` | **Date**: 2025-09-16 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-create-a-personal/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Create a professional personal portfolio website that presents a developer's profile in a clear and comprehensive way. The site will showcase work experience, education, skills, projects, and contact information using Next.js with App Router, TailwindCSS, and shadcn/ui components. All content will be dynamically rendered from JSON data, ensuring easy maintenance and extensibility.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript with Next.js 15+ (latest version with App Router)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js, React, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui, TypeScript  
**Storage**: Static JSON data file in frontend (no database required)  
**Testing**: Jest with React Testing Library for component tests  
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (desktop and mobile responsive)
**Project Type**: web - single frontend application  
**Performance Goals**: <3s initial page load, 60fps animations, Core Web Vitals optimized  
**Constraints**: Static site generation compatible, mobile-first responsive design, accessibility compliant  
**Scale/Scope**: Single-page portfolio site with 7 main sections, modular component architecture

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

No constitutional requirements identified from constitution template. Portfolio website follows standard web development patterns with:
- Single frontend application (no complex architecture)
- Standard testing approach with Jest/RTL
- Component-based design for reusability
- Static data approach for simplicity
- No violations detected.

**Status**: PASS - No constitutional constraints apply to this portfolio website project.

├── models/
├── services/
├── cli/
└── lib/

# Option 2: Web application (when "frontend" + "backend" detected)

└── tests/

# Option 3: Mobile + API (when "iOS/Android" detected)
api/
└── [same as backend above]

ios/ or android/
└── [platform-specific structure]
```

**Structure Decision**: Single project (Option 1) - This is a frontend-only portfolio website with no backend API required. Static JSON data approach means no separate services layer needed.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Create Next.js project setup tasks
- Component creation tasks following TDD approach
- Integration and validation tasks
- Deployment preparation tasks

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Project setup and dependencies first
- Data layer (JSON file, TypeScript interfaces)
- Core UI components (Layout, Section wrapper)
- Individual section components in logical order
- Testing and validation tasks
- Mark [P] for parallel execution where components are independent

**Specific Task Categories**:
1. **Setup Tasks**: Next.js project, shadcn/ui installation, dependencies
2. **Data Tasks**: JSON file creation, TypeScript interfaces, validation
3. **Layout Tasks**: Header, Footer, Section wrapper components
4. **Section Tasks**: Hero, About, Experience, Education, Skills, Projects, Activities, Contact
5. **Testing Tasks**: Unit tests, integration tests, accessibility testing
6. **Polish Tasks**: SEO, performance optimization, responsive testing

**Estimated Output**: 35-40 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
