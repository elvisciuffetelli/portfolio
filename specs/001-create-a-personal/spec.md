## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A potential employer, client, or collaborator visits the portfolio website to learn about the developer's background, skills, and experience. They need to quickly understand the developer's expertise, view their work history and projects, and have easy access to contact information and ways to connect professionally.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a visitor lands on the portfolio homepage, **When** they view the hero section, **Then** they see the developer's full name, role as Frontend Developer, and a tagline describing their skills and value
2. **Given** a visitor wants to contact the developer, **When** they look at the hero section or footer, **Then** they find quick access buttons/links to download CV, send email, view LinkedIn profile, and access GitHub
3. **Given** a visitor wants to learn about the developer's background, **When** they scroll to the About Me section, **Then** they see a professional description highlighting React ecosystem expertise, UX/UI focus, code quality commitment, and personal interests like fitness, cycling, and trekking
4. **Given** a visitor wants to understand work experience, **When** they view the Work Experience section, **Then** they see a chronological list of positions with role, company, period, and key responsibilities/achievements
5. **Given** a visitor wants to assess technical capabilities, **When** they view the Skills section, **Then** they see skills grouped by categories with optional proficiency indicators
6. **Given** a visitor wants to see practical work examples, **When** they view the Personal Projects section, **Then** they see featured projects like tracciapesi.app with descriptions, goals, and optional links/previews
7. **Given** a visitor wants to learn about community involvement, **When** they view the Extra-Curricular Activities section, **Then** they see volunteering work, open-source contributions, and international experiences

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the CV download link is unavailable or the file is missing?
- How does the page display on mobile devices and tablets?
- What happens if project links become unavailable?
- How does the page handle users with disabilities or screen readers?
